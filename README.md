![YEN vs USD FX Trading ](unit-10-readme-photo.jpg)

The financial departments of large companies often deal with foreign currency transactions while doing international business. As a result, they are always looking for anything that can help them better understand the future direction and risk of various currencies. Hedge funds, too, are keenly interested in anything that will give them a consistent edge in predicting currency movements.

In this assignment, I  will use the time-series tools  to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. 
To be able to predict, I  performed both the Time Series Forecasting and Linear Regression Modeling
Using  the dataset  from 1990 as an input for the time series  forecasting, I ran the following models to make predictions on various aspects of the Yen trading days:

•	ARMA Model - to forecast returns

•	ARIMA Model - to forecast price

•	GARCH Model - to forecast volatility

Based on the result of the analysis using these models, although there could be short-term buying opportunity,  It will be unwise to buy yen for a long time investment  since the returns on the Yen should decrease and having high volatility.

From the linear regression analysis one can deduce that the out of sample performed slightly better than the In-sample data. The Out-of-sample had a root mean squared error of 0.415, while the in-sample data has an RMSE of .596. From this data I would say the model has a "good" fit.
